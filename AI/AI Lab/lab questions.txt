In this problem the salesman starts at one point from one place and travels all the places compare to this starting point
or place.the objective of this problem is to minimize or optimize the cost.the main requirement communication blw two nodes or cities.
the problem containstwo steps :
step1 : g(i,phi)=Ci,1 where 1<=i<=n
step2 : Min{Cij+g(J1 s-{J})

Q)we have 2 water jugs one measures 'x' gallons and the other one measures 'y' gallons
but there is no measuring level mentioned on either of these jugs i.e. we cannot know the
exact amount of water filled in the jug.If we want to know how ?
fill 2 gallons of water in any one of this jugs?
Q)state space for this problem can be described as the set of ordered pair of integers.
Here x represents the capacity or quantity of water in 4 gallons i.e,x= 1,2,3,4
and y represents the capacity or quanity of water in 3 gallons i.e,y= 0,1,2,3

Searching strategies in ai
best first search in ai:BFS is an instance of the general research or drop search algorithm
in which a node is selected for expansion based on an evaluation function f(n).The evaluation
function is constructed as a cost estimate so the node the lowest evaluation is expanded first.
Most of the best first search algorithms include as a component of a heuristic function denoted as h(n)
f(n)=evaluation function
h(n)=estimated cost of the cheapest path from starting node to goal node
From node a the next node to be selected is node b.then from node b select node f.since 
f have no childs backtrack to node b and select node b.....till reaching the goal node
uniformed Search :[Blind Search]
BFS
DFS
Uniform cost search


Greedy best first Search:
GBFS always selects the path which is best at particular stage.it is combination of bfs and dfs and uses the heuristic function
to search the next node .The BFS algorithm to expand the node which is closest to goal node and the min cost is estimated by heuristic function
the evaluation function f(n)=h(n) where h(n) is estimated cost from starting node to goal node.The greedy bfs 
cost of the path that has already been traversed therfore the solution given is necessarily optimal
Space and time complexity :
O(b^m) where b:branching factor
m: depth of the tree
